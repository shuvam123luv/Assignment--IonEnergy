The Codes in   the visualization of Battery Mangement system of a Telecom Dataset.

To find the relation ship between the variables in Dataset, the technique used are :-
1)  Pearson correlation
2)Spearman's Rank correlation

# Relationship Between Grid Status and SOC

SpearmanrResult(correlation=0.16756363907401717, pvalue=1.2301165872017372e-194)
The result state that there is very low correlation between between Grid Status and SOC.

# Relationship Between Equivalent cycle and SOH

Correlation_SOH_VS_Equivalentcycle: 
SpearmanrResult(correlation=-0.9999891918148036, pvalue=0.0)
Pearson Coefficient: (-0.9842624478536393, 0.0)

The result states that this two variables are highly negatively coorelated, which means increase in a value of a variables causes decrease in value of other one.


# Relation Between Temperature and SOC

Pearson Coefficient:(-0.36904035326610596, 0.0)
Spearman Coefficient: SpearmanrResult(correlation=-0.2066032952919746, pvalue=5.306806318224385e-297)

The result shows that two variable are moderately negative correlated.
